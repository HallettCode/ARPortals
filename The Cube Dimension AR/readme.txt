-- The Cube Dimension AR --

This is the first mobile/AR build for this project. This build ensured the compatibility of skyboxes across all devices without issue, and implemented Augmented Reality via ARCore. 

This app requires an Android device with Android 7.0 or 7.1, as well as access to the camera. Remember to allow unknown sources for this app to run.
